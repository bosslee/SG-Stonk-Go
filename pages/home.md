SG Stonk Go is an add-on to bring Yahoo Finance Stocks and ETFs data into your Google Sheets. 

## Why build this?

I wanted to use Google Sheets to monitor my stocks portfolio. 
For US stocks, Google Finance function works great 
However if you are looking for Singapore Stocks data you will faced into a problem.

The solution here is to build a custom function that pulls in Yahoo Finance data into Google Sheets.
This is the video tutorial

There are also friends who shared that they are less comfortable writing scripts
So I went ahead and turn it into a Google Sheets add-on
