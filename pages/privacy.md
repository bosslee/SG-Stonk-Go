The code can only access your data while you’re accessing the add-on. 
It does not have direct access to your data.

It leverages on the Google’s Property Service which allows it to attach limited data (such as saved API requests) to the spreadsheet itself and to the user, on Google’s servers. 

The add-on also does not log any data about the API you call, or the parameters you selected. And does not have access to view any of the information stored in your Sheets nor any of your saved API information.
